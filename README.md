Explore an extensive database of motor specifications and configurations, ideal for engineers, hobbyists, and anyone interested in the technical details of various motors.

## About the Project

The Motor Database is an essential resource for engineers, hobbyists, and anyone with a keen interest in motor technology. While it's particularly useful for those in the FPV drone community, its comprehensive collection of motor specifications and configurations makes it a valuable tool for a wide range of applications. Whether you're designing a drone, a small machine, or simply exploring motor technology, this database is here to provide the detailed information you need.

## Features

- **Extensive Data Collection**: Detailed specifications of motors from various manufacturers.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-navigate database for quick information retrieval.
- **Open Contribution**: Community-driven updates and contributions to keep the database comprehensive and up-to-date.

## Using the Database

Access the Motor Database through the [website](https://marc-frank.github.io/motor-database/). You can search for motors based on different criteria such as manufacturer, specifications, and more.

## Contributing

Your contributions make the Motor Database richer and more accurate. Whether it's adding new motors, updating existing data, or suggesting features, all contributions are welcome. Check out the [Contribution Guidelines](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details on how you can contribute.

## Future Plans

- **Interactive Visualizations**: Developing dashboards for better data visualization and interpretation.
