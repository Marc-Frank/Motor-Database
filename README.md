## How to contribute

Clone the repository to your account.

Before adding a new table row to the index.html, check to make sure the motor isn't already in the list

If it already has an entry, you can directly edit the fields by typing in the parameters

 

To simplify the creation of the html code, you can use the MotorDatabaseFormatter
